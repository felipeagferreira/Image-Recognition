# Food Classifier

The goal of this project is to build a model that classifies food from their images. We use TensorFlow and Keras to create convolutional neural networks that can be efficiently trained to classify all the food images of the datasets.

In order to run fster the code we use GPU mode, which can be achieved by following these steps: click open a Google Colab notebook, click 'Runtime', then 'Change Runtime', choose GPU and then click 'Save'.
